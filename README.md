## Hi I'm Ashok ðŸ‘‹

I am a 2nd year student studying computer science at Cornell Universityâ€™s College of Engineering.

I have a deep interest in big data. Through my internships at F5 Networks and Micro Focus and many other personal projects, I have seen the power of effient and large scale coding methods. I am also a Full Stack developer on the Cornell Cup Robotics Team.

Outside of coding I enjoy playing golf, investing in the stock market, and have the unique ability to binge watch any tv show.
